    <h2>Proposition: Decreasing the number of abortion clinics available leads to a lower abortion rate in U.S. states

      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

				<figcaption>
					Scatter Plot showing correlation between abortion clinic closure and abortion rate by state
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Scatter Plot</li>
				<p>+2. Pretty common method used to represent and compare data about multiple different places/groups.
					A reliable and non-confusing chart that should come across at least neutrally to viewers if not positively.
				</p>
				<li>Red Dots for Scatter plot</li>
				<p>+1. This is a color that grabs the viewer's attention and implies urgency and/or bad things. Not inherently misleading
					here though.
				</p>
				<li>X-axis Range</li>
				<p>-1. The range on the x-axis isn't evenly weighted; it goes from -75 to 100. It covers the range of the data points
					but could slightly misleads and makes the graph look weighted to the left, which indicates more negative
					changes in abortion clinic numbers. Gets rid of empty visual space but sacrifices symmetry and consistency.</p>
