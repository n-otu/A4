    <h2>Proposition: Decreasing the number of abortion clinics available leads to a lower abortion rate in U.S. states
	</h2>

      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="images/prop_support.png" alt="chart showing correlation between abortion clinics and the abortion rate" />
				<figcaption>
					Scatter Plot showing correlation between abortion clinic closure and abortion rate by state
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Scatter Plot</li>
				<p>+2. Pretty common method used to represent and compare data about multiple different places/groups.
					A reliable and non-confusing chart that should come across at least neutrally to viewers if not positively.
				</p>
				<li>Red Dots for Scatter plot</li>
				<p>+1. This is a color that grabs the viewer's attention and implies urgency and/or bad things. Not inherently misleading
					here though.
				</p>
				<li>X-axis Range</li>
				<p>-1. The range on the x-axis isn't evenly weighted; it goes from -75 to 100. It covers the range of the data points
					but could slightly misleads and makes the graph look weighted to the left, which indicates more negative
					changes in abortion clinic numbers. Gets rid of empty visual space but sacrifices symmetry and consistency.</p>
			</ul>

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="images/prop_refute.png" alt="a chart " />
				<figcaption>
          			Graph showing comparing abortion clinic closure with abortion rates by state
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Grid Lines</li>
				<p>+2. Helps compare points clearly and understand values. Helps ensure that viewer doesn't just see
					points floating in space or trends but solid values to go with every data point.
				</p>
				<li>Significant closure line</li>
				<p>-1.5. The percentage (20%) used to determing a major closure for the lines is arbitrary, and may
					instead mislead viewers by over-emphasizing certain data points and their meanings. Helpful for letting viewers
					know what may be major points of interest but super dependent on what the creator deems to be major, and so
					can be misleading.
				</p>
				<li>Linear Axis Scaling</li>
				<p>+2. Makes sure the data is represented proportionally. Avoids any weird bending or representations of data and
					is a very common choice of axis scaling.
				</p>
			</ul>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>The information itself was surprising to me at first, until I remembered the vast amount of political, economic, and social going-ons that couldn’t possible be represented by the chart. It didn’t account for political events, or who was getting abortions in each states (out-of-state travel) and so many other factors that create the bigger picture of this topic.
		</p><p>
		I would define ethical analysis and visualization as data-handling practices that provide as much contextual information as possible and represent data as neutrally as is practical. There is always some degree of user input when it comes to creating data visualizations, and in the process of trimming and cleaning up data information can be lost or otherwise unknown to viewers who only see the finished product. If that information may majorly change the perception of the visualization then that should be conveyed somehow in the visualization itself or somewhere else in the presentation. I think that while there isn’t a super strict bound in terms of acceptable and misleading choices, anything reasonably chosen that doesn’t significantly influence perception is likely alright.
